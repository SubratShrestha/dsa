# Data Structures and Algorithms
A handy collection of useful data structures and algorithms for quick reference in C++.

Quick list:
- Segment trees for $$O(logN)$$ update and query with O(N) precomputation.
- Union Find for almost O(1) joins/unions and almost O(1) find after O(N) precomputation.
- Representation of graph as an adjacency list.
- DFS on a graph using adjacency list in O(|V + E|).
- BFS on a graph using adjacency list in O(|V + E|).
- Detect cycles in a directed graph using adjacency list in O(|V + E|).
- Lowest common ancestor using Binary Lifting in O(logN) per query.
- Topological sort of a graph in O(|V + E|).
- Tarjan's algorithm to find strongly connected components in O(|V + E|).
- Kruskal's algorithm for minimum spanning tree in O(ElogE) time.

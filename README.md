# Data Structures and Algorithms
A handy collection of useful data structures and algorithms for quick reference.

Quick list:
- Segment trees for O(logn) update and query with O(n) precomputation.
- Union Find for almost O(1) joins/unions and almost O(1) find after O(n) precomputation.
- DFS on a graph using adjacency list in O(|V + E|)
- BFS on a graph using adjacency list in O(|V + E|)
- Detect cycles in a directed graph using adjacency list in O(|V + E|)
